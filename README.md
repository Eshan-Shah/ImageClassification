# Image Classification using LeNet-5 on MNIST

This project involves developing an image classification model capable of recognizing handwritten digits using the LeNet-5 convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture. The model is trained on the MNIST dataset as part of an internship under the supervision of Prof. Huiyu Zhou at the University of Leicester.
