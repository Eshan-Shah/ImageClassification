# üß† Image Classification using multiple CNN architectures

This project focuses on developing and comparing multiple convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures; LeNet-5, VGG, and ResNet-50 for handwritten digit recognition using the MNIST dataset. The work was conducted as part of an internship under the supervision of Prof. Huiyu Zhou at the University of Leicester.

## üèóÔ∏è Implemented Models

- **LeNet-5**  
  A pioneering CNN architecture designed for digit recognition. Serves as a baseline model for the project.

- **VGG**  
  A deeper architecture with multiple convolutional layers stacked sequentially, known for its simplicity and strong performance.

- **ResNet-50**  
  A highly sophisticated CNN using residual learning to enable training of very deep networks without vanishing gradients.

Each model was trained and evaluated on the MNIST dataset using standardized metrics such as accuracy and loss curves.
